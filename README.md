# Fedora Kernel Build

I use this to build custom kernels when I am asked to apply a patch from
bugzilla. It may or may not work for you. Feel free to do whatever with it.
This is based on a method that I found works for Fedora 31 onward from
https://passthroughpo.st/agesa_fix_fedora, which is actually a slightly less
confusing document compared to what I was able to find and run from Fedora such
as https://docs.pagure.org/docs-fedora/building-custom-kernel.html, 
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Building_a_custom_kernel, and 
https://fedoramagazine.org/building-fedora-kernel.
